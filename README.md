# AirQualityMonitor
Air Quality Graphical Display using the ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-7 and SGP-40 sensor.

This also requires the LVGL component library (version 8.3) to be in the components folder. It is already there, but it is present in two .zip files (lvgl1.zip and lvgl2.zip) that need to be unpacked into their current location (within components/lvgl__lvgl). 

For modifying this project with SquareLine Studio, please see: https://github.com/GodOfjiz/SquareLine-Studio-for-ESP32-S3-Touch-LCD-4.3-7 for details on how to do that.
